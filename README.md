<p>To create a platform through which electors can get precise and enough information about their 
present legislative candidates and the participating candidates during the election. We aim to collect data from India's election commission at 
the nomination time (electorial time). These details include personal details such as assets, age, education, cash liquidity(value submitted by self), 
and professional information such as current party name and ex govt positions. We also represent archives of previously contested elections, the votes obtained, the number of wins in a pictorial, 
and easy to refer manner even for a layperson. We regularly update the candidates' news obtained through web scraping like the Twitter handle, recent Facebook posts, 
Instagram posts, and other social platforms. In a nutshell, we collect 
the available public data about our candidates and represent them in a user-friendly way. 
Every common man can utilize the information to vote for their candidate wisely.  </p>
